2. How many Generic tokens are being sold?
a. Generic ICO is selling 400 million of the total 1 billion initial supply. See our whitepaper for details on the remaining supply.

3. What is the price of a Generic token?
a. The pricing is calculated in Tiers. The price for each Tier is equal to the total aggregate amount raised (in $USD)/150,000,000. For example, if Generic ICO raises $3 million in Tier 1(first 6 hours), the price is $0.02 ($3 million/150 million). In subsequent Tiers, the total raised is added to the numerator. If we raise $2,000,000 in Tier 2, the price will be calculated $5 million/150 million= $0.033 per token. Therefore, the price increases for each subsequent tier based on the total amount raised.
